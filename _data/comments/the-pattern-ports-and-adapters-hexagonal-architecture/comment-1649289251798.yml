message: "Hi, Bagrat - Why do you steal other people's articles? This article was written by Juan Manuel Garrido de Paz, who put a lot of work into it. You didn't ask him for permission to republish it, and you don't even give him credit. That is theft. \r\n\r\nYou also copied my article without permission (https://mbagrat.com/architecture/the-pattern-ports-and-adapters-object-structural/ is a copy of my foundational article: https://alistair.cockburn.us/hexagonal-architecture/ )\r\n\r\nPlease take down these two articles as they are pure theft."
